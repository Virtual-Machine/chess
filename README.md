###Chess
My attempt to build a broswer chess engine that follows all the standard rules of NA play.

Currently Implemented:
No piece can capture a piece of its own color.
No color can move out of order and White plays first.(Temporarily commented out for ease of testing)
Pawns can move 1 or 2 squares forward on their first move and 1 square forward after that so long as they do not jump on or over another piece.
Pawns can capture via a 1 square forward diagonal move.
Pawns can capture via En Passant.
When a Pawn reaches the end of the board, it can be promoted to Bishop, Knight, Rook or Queen at the player's discretion.
Standard Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen, and King Movement.
