###Chess
My attempt to build a broswer chess engine that follows all the standard rules of NA play.

Currently Implemented:
No piece can capture a piece of its own color.
No color can move out of order.
White plays first.
Pawns can move 1 or 2 squares forward on their first move and 1 square forward after that so long as they do not jump on or over another piece.
Pawns can capture via a 1 square forward diagonal move.
Pawns can capture via En Passant.
When a Pawn reaches the end of the board, it can be promoted to Bishop, Knight, Rook or Queen at the player's discretion.

Not Yet Implemented:
Rook Movement
Bishop Movement
Knight Movement
Queen Movement
King Movement
Castling
Check and Checkmate
Stalemate
3 Fold Repetition
50 Move Rule
Impossibility of Checkmate
Mutual Draws
Stat UI
